Monospace is a social network for developers. It's our sample Rails application, showing how to use Stripe to charge subscribers.

Monospace uses the Stripe Javascript bindings to validate a credit card, and the Stripe Ruby bindings to create a customer and add the credit card to that customer. Customers can also update their credit card.
